The daddy Bala Krishna with Nayanatara next to him and Kota Srinivas Rao playing the bad guy in a war between good and evil about the welfare of the region is the film\u2019s flashback",

But that script was smudged with ink after 60th page (25th scene). He summons his assistant to scout for the writer and takes Rishi for story discussions on that script to his remote wooden guesthouse located few kilometers away from the city. The scenes mentioned in the script come alive. As the things get scary, Aravind wants to see what would happen in the next scene and realize that the rest of the script is smudged by ink. The rest of the story is all about what happens next.",

Whenever a problem crops between the two, it is usually settled with a bitter scrum on the rugby field. As it happens, the college land falls into the hands of a local dadha Bikshu Yadav. This is good enough reason for the two groups to forge a common identity and fight for the land. Prithvi and Shashank bury the hatchet and get back the land. This is too much of a bitter pill for the dadha to swallow. And so he dares the students for a rugby match with his own group.",

        "overview": "'Astram' is the remake of hindi movie 'Sarfarosh' which starred Aamir Khan in lead. The movie was a hit at that time. Suresh Krishna has tried to match the present cast with that of the original. His selection of script is an upset to the audience. He has selected Vishnu in lead but failed to have actual grip on the movie.  Vishnu has performed well as a responsible IPS officer. This can be stated as his best job till now. The guy has a long way to go. Anushka, as Vishnu's ladylove, adds glamour to the movie. Though Jackie Shroff's role is short, his performance is fine. The technical aspects of the movie are pass muster. Music by S.A.Rajkumar is a mediocre. Suresh Krishna's direction, screenplay are okay.",

Hamsa Vahini (Sneha) is a girl who believes strongly in human bonds and trusts everybody easily. Hamsa likes Sanjay immensely and proposes to marry him. Sanjay too accepts the proposal. In a casual chitchat, Sanjay reveals that he does not love her though he is marrying her. He feels that it is a marriage of convenience and practicality. Sanjay's confession hurts Hamsa and she cancels the engagement. As Sanjay slowly realizes the power of love and starts missing her, Hamsa becomes pragmatic and practical due to her family related circumstances, and ignores his pleas for forgiveness. The rest of the story is all about how she finally accepts Sanjay's love.",

With some needed twists that lend a feel-good touch, apart from a love triangle, the movie makes a bid to impress the audience. Director Sreenu, who has had some directorial experience before, takes the credit for shaping the story in such a way that it looks different. The film can be termed musical, for it deals with lots of inter-college music competitions. -- Jeevi @ Idlebrain.com",

Ganesh is a player with precession in matters involving women. He believes love lies below the belt and not within the heart. As destiny would have its way to prove the human mind wrong, he finds himself smitten by Sandhya. To get closer to her, he lands himself a job in the same office as hers with the sole motive of convincing her to live with him.  Cupid does his job and Ganesh charms Sandhya. The intertwining comedy of errors ends with Ganesh and Sandhya getting into a relationship for the weekends. But as the saying goes, a straight road gets boring. A few killer curves sprinkled with a couple of speed breakers make the journey worth remembering and leave the audience curious .",

        "overview": "The film deals with the social issues of literacy, women empowerment and development and comments on the importance of literacy in the Indian villages, which is important for the progress of the country. In the film, Madhukar and Jaggu are Hitler-like tyrants who rule over a small community with an iron hand. They prefer to keep the inhabitants illiterate, so that they can continue to oppress and abuse them over time. But one young lad, Ramu, educates himself secretly with the help of the local school-master, Srikanth. Years later, Ramu has grown up and is now a formidable force to reckon with. Madhukar and Jaggu see him as a threat and soon spin a web of lies and deceit around him, leaving him with no alternative except to retreat, leaving the poor villagers once again at their mercy of their oppressors.",
